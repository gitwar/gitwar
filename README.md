# Gitwar

Head-to-head gaming with git at the center.

The idea is simple. You run a game in your console, it logs your actions into a
git repo, pushes them to a remote repo your opponent has access to, their game
syncs with the repo, and prompts them for their move. Keep going until only one
of you is left standing.

You can build all kinds of games on top of this pattern.

Some games that I have in the works are...

- [Gitfight] [1]: Virtual boxing
- [Gitchess] [2]: Chess, duh!
- [Gitpoke] [3]: Pokemon battles!
- Gitgo: Go board game (Coming soon)
